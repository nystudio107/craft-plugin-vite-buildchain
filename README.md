## Requirements

* Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then copy the contents (including the hidden `.gitignore` file) into the root directory of your plugin via:

```
git clone https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-plugin-vite-buildchain.git
cp craft-plugin-vite-buildchain/* path/to/plugin/dir
```

It's done this way as a "starter" rather than as a package, because every plugin/module will make bespoke changes to it.

## Craft Plugin Vite Buildchain Overview

Craft Plugin Vite Buildchain is a drop-in buildchain you can use in your Craft CMS plugins and modules, giving you Hot Module Replacement, Tailwind CSS, and optimized production builds.

You shouldn't need to install this yourself unless you're using it in a Craft CMS plugin or Module.
